	Kremica was coded entirely by Ryan Johnston, a senior at the University
	of Pittsburgh. Kremica is meant to be an enjoyable (yet frustrating)
	game that will not over-burden a student. Rather, the game functions as
	something to do on a quick study break. Make a character, play until the
	character dies, go back to studying.
